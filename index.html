<h1>I grow iteratively</h1>
<blockquote> Nothing is permanent. Everything is subject to change. Being is always becoming. - Buddha
</blockquote>
<p>I wholeheartedly embrace failure as a necessity for improvement, and I am perpetually in search of new opportunities that will both challenge and stimulate me. I think that the surest means to improvement, whether for an individual or collective, is to test the waters with an idea and then look to the ripples. So far I have found the pursuit of common understanding between myself and those with whom I interact to be a good metric, and applying this philosophy to my roles as a student, educator, and innovator gives me great fulfillment.
</p>
<h1>For me, teaching and learning are symbiotic</h1>
<ul>
  <li>I currently serve as a TA and mentor for the computer science courses at Pomona College, where I strive to share with my peers the habits and mentalities I've found most helpful.</li>
  <li>This summer I worked on a Physics Education Workspace Application to help introductory level physics students hone their problem-solving processes.</li>
  <li>Before returning to Pomona, I combined the experience I had gained as a TA with some of the techniques I implemented as a researcher over the summer to teach a Chromebook-based digital literacy curriculum to homeless women and other community members at my hometown library.
  <li>I also run the Claremont Philosophers, a club aimed at making philosophy more accessible so that more people might benefit from its applications to everyday life.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Current Coursework</h2>
<p>Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Ancient Philosophy, a Kant seminar, and whatever invitations to increase my understanding I find along the way.</p>
